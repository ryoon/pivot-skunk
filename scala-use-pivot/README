
Scala-Use-Pivot
=====================

This is a sample application that show the usage of Apache Pivot from Scala.

To avoid usage of external libraries this project requires the base Pivot projects
in the classpath (or Project Dependencies), so for example it's possible to test it
directly with Pivot projects coming from the development trunk.

Scala is expected to be found in the classpath, for example could be provided
by the Scala Plugin for the IDE.

Project Structure and Folder Organization:
- Note that this project has the same structure of a maven-generated project,
  because in another project we'll convert this to a real maven project.
- The test folder is optional.
- Resources have been moved in resources folder(s) but it's optional,
  and done here only to show a better organization of contents.
- To avoid putting content in a wrong folder, any source folder will be
  filtered by extension during compilation.
- For simplify execution, some eclipse launch files have been put inside the eclipse folder.
- The Project is tested under Eclipse-3.5.x
