
Scala-Use-Pivot - TODO
======================

- add some real (ant) build tasks, and maybe also a maven build pom.xml

- finish to verify for licensing problems (if the info in NOTICE and README is correct,
if there are problems with eclipse launch files, etc)

- later, add other Pivot Tutorials/Samples, but rewritten here in Scala
