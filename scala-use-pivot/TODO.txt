
Scala-Use-Pivot - TODO
======================

- add a trim-whitespace (ant) build task, like in the rest of Pivot, optional but useful

- finish to verify for licensing problems (if the info in NOTICE and README is correct, 
if there are problems with eclipse launch files, etc)

- later, add other Pivot Tutorials/Samples, but rewritten here in Scala
